 DO NOT USE IT, USE NEEDLE (I am not sponsored) https://engine.needle.tools/docs/getting-started.html

I make no apologies for the spaghetti-code you will find here. Hope this helps someone understand how to convert geometry and lightmaps from Unity to three.js space.

How to use: paste into your assets folder
Window > Ex Machina Soft > Export Selection to three.js.
